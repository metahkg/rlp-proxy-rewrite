  title: RLP proxy (rewrite) api
  description: "# RLP proxy (rewrite)
    Proxy for [react-link-preview](https://github.com/dhaiwat10/react-link-preview).

    Written from scratch to reimplement [rlp-proxy](https://github.com/Dhaiwat10/rlp-proxy), which is all rights reserved.

    ## Features

    - this proxy is based on puppeteer, therefore it is able to work with most sites, including react apps such as
    [metahkg.org](https://metahkg.org).
    - more sites can be accessed with [puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth).
    - uses fastify (instead of express)
    - caching with mongodb, also caches null metadata
    - auto delete successful caches after 30 days, null caches after 1 day
    - 5 seconds timeout

    ## Compatibility

    - `/v2` is highly compatible with the original `rlp-proxy`, however it DOES NOT give an error code when the site is not found / the site gives out any errors, simply returns `{ metadata: null }`
    - the querystring `url` should be UTF-8 encoded, or some urls may not be supported
    - this proxy does not support v1, `/` is an alias of `/v2`

    ## Other information

    - rate limit:
      - cached: 1000 / 30 seconds
      - uncached: 5 / 30 seconds
    - *Warning*: slower since it uses puppeteer
    - manifest support not yet available, as [metascraper-manifest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metascraper-manifest) does not have types."
